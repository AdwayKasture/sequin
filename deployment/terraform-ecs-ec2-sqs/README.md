# Terraform ECS EC2 SQS Deployment

⚠️ **Special Deployment - Not for Widespread Use**

This is a specialized deployment configuration that includes SQS components. It is intended for specific use cases and is not recommended for general deployment purposes.

## Usage

This deployment extends the base `terraform-ecs-ec2` configuration with additional SQS resources and configurations.

## Important Notes

- This configuration is maintained separately from the main deployment
- Only use this deployment if specifically directed to do so
- For standard deployments, use `terraform-ecs-ec2` instead
