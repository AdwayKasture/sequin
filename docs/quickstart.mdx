<Steps titleSize="h2">
  <Step title="Create a Sequin account" titleSize="h2">
    If you haven't already, create a [Sequin cloud account](https://console.sequinstream.com/register) and login.

    <Note>If you're looking to self-host Sequin, start with our [self-hosting guide](/self-hosting/installation).</Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect your database">
    In the Sequin Console, click on the **Connect Database** button. Enter the connection details for your Postgres database (i.e. host, port, database name, username, and password).

    </Frame>

    With your database connected, you'll now create a replication slot. This allows Sequin to efficiently capture changes from your database using the WAL (Write-Ahead Log)

    In your database, run the following SQL command to create a replication slot:

    ```sql Create Replication Slot
    select pg_create_logical_replication_slot('sequin_slot', 'pgoutput');
    ```

    To finish setting up your replication slot, you'll also create a publication to indicate which tables will publish changes to the replication slot.

    In your database, run the following SQL command to create a publication:

    <CodeGroup>
    ```sql Create Publication for all tables
    create publication sequin_pub for all tables;
    ```

    ```sql Create Publication for specific tables
    create publication sequin_pub for table table1, table2, table3;
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

    Back in the Sequin Console, enter the name of the replication slot (e.g. `sequin_slot`) and publication (e.g. `sequin_pub`) you just created. Then, name your database and click **Create Database**.

    Your database is now connected to Sequin!

    <Note>
    You may see that the database status is `waiting` until Sequin sees a change come through the replication slot. This is completely normal.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a consumer">
    On the database page, click the **Add a consumer** button. Alternatively, you can navigate to the **Consumers** page and click **CreateConsumer**.

     As a first step, you'll select whether you want your consumer to process rows or changes:

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/cloud-getting-started/stream-kind.png" alt="Select stream kind" />
    </Frame>

    * **Rows**: Process rows to capture the latest state of records. Sequin delivers messages to the consumer whenever a row is inserted or updated. Learn more about rows [here](/core-concepts#rows-and-changes).
    * **Changes**: Process changes to capture every `insert`, `update`, and `delete`. This includes `OLD` values for updates and deletes. Learn more about changes [here](/core-concepts#rows-and-changes).


    Next, select whether you want to recieve changes via HTTP Push (i.e. Webhooks) or HTTP Pull (i.e. SQS). For this quickstart, we'll select HTTP Push:

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/cloud-getting-started/consumer-type.png" alt="Select consumer type" />
    </Frame>

    You'll now select the database and the tables you want to capture changes from and define any filters for the changes you want to capture:

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/cloud-getting-started/set-filters.png" alt="Select consumer filters" />
    </Frame>

    Here, we've selected the `public.users` table and applied a filter to only capture changes to records where the `age` value is less than `25`. Click **Continue**.

    On the next screen, enter a name for your consumer. Under "HTTP Endpoint", you can click the link " Create and use a new Webhook.site endpoint." This will generate a new HTTP endpoint on Webhook.site that you can use for test purposes:

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/cloud-getting-started/set_http_endpoint.png" alt="Set endpoint" />
    </Frame>

    Finally, click on **Create Consumer** to finish creating your consumer:

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/cloud-getting-started/consumer-created.png" alt="Consumer created" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Capture changes">
    You've now connected your database to Sequin, setup a consumer to capture changes, and defined where to send the changes. The last step is to trigger a message to see this in action.

    To trigger a message, insert a new row on your table. You'll see a new message arrive at your endpoint:

    ![End to end quickstart example](https://i.imgur.com/oT5qh1O.gif)

    After the record is inserted, it appears as a JSON object in the message payload sent to your endpoint.

    <Note>Keep in mind, that Sequin will automatically retry sending messages on failure to provide an exactly-once processing guarantee.</Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Next steps

You've now walked through the basics of connecting your database, creating a consumer, and capturing changes. Now, you can write the business logic for your application to react to the changes.

From here, you might want to:

* Learn more about [rows](/core-concepts#rows-and-changes) and [changes](/core-concepts#rows-and-changes).
* Explore the advanced configurations for push consumers and pull consumers.
* Install and configure the [Sequin SDK](https://github.com/sequin-io/sequin-go) to pull changes into your application.
* Star the repository to follow the latest updates.
