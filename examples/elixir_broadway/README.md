# ElixirBroadway

ElixirBroadway is an Elixir application using the Broadway data processing library.

In this example project, the Broadway pipline is configured using the [OffBroadwaySequin](https://github.com/sequinstream/off_broadway_sequin) hex package. Use this project as a quick start for building a Broadway pipeline using Sequin streams.

## Installation

by adding `elixir_broadway` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
